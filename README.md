This tutorial will guide you through deploying an OKD 4.7 cluster that is as minimal as possible.  It will consist of one node which is both master and worker.

You will need a CentOS Streams linux host with 2 cores and at least 32GB of RAM.

I am using a [NUC8i3BEK](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/126149/intel-nuc-kit-nuc8i3bek.html) with 32GB of RAM for my host. This little box with 32GB of RAM is perfect for this purpose, and also very portable for throwing in a bag to take my dev environment with me.  Also check out the newer [NUC10i3FNK](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/195503/intel-nuc-10-performance-kit-nuc10i3fnk.html).  It will support 64GB of RAM!

Much of the material for this minimal cluster is borrowed from my other OKD 4.4 tutorial.  If you are interested in building a full OKD 4.4 cluster, then check it out here: [OKD 4.X Lab](https://cgruver.github.io/okd4-upi-lab-setup/).
